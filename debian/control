Description: Lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor
 yq is a lightweight and portable command-line YAML, JSON and XML
 processor. yq uses jq like syntax but works with yaml files as well as
 json and xml. It doesn't yet support everything jq does - but it does
 support the most common operations and functions, and more is being
 added continuously.
